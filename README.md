# ECG-Pulse-Monitor-system-with-IOT
Heart diseases are becoming a big issue for the last few decades and many people die because of certain health problems. Therefore, heart disease cannot be taken lightly. By analyzing or monitoring the ECG signal at the initial stage this disease can be prevented. So we present this project, i.e ECG Monitoring with AD8232 ECG Sensor & NodeMcu with ECG IOT Graph.

The AD8232 is a neat little chip used to measure the electrical activity of the heart. This electrical activity can be charted as an ECG or Electrocardiogram. Electrocardiography is used to help diagnose various heart conditions.

## What is ECG?
An ECG is a paper or digital recording of the electrical signals in the heart. It is also called an electrocardiogram or an EKG. The ECG is used to determine heart rate, heart rhythm, and other information regarding the heartâ€™s condition. ECGs are used to help diagnose heart arrhythmias, heart attacks, pacemaker function, and heart failure.
## What is thingspeak?
ThingSpeak is IoT Cloud platform where you can send sensor data to the cloud. You can also analyze and visualize your data with MATLAB or other software, including making your own applications.
The ThingSpeak service is operated by MathWorks. In order to sign up for ThingSpeak, you must create a new MathWorks Account or log in to your existing MathWorks Account.
ThingSpeak is free for small non-commercial projects.
ThingSpeak includes a Web Service (REST API) that lets you collect and store sensor data in the cloud and develop Internet of Things applications. It works with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and MATLAB (premade libraries and APIs exists) But it should work with all kind of Programming Languages, since it uses a REST API and HTTP.
## Methods
* AD8232 ECG Sensor should connect with Analog Pins of NodeMCU 
* Setup the probe with human body and connect with nodemuc with 5v power supply
* Red Light will get activate on AD8232 ECG Sensor
* SCAN  or visit the link in which thingspeak cloud graph has been displayed
